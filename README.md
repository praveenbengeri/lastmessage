Last Message Service
======================
**Hope one never needs to use this...**

Think of those families who lost their loved ones unexpectedly and are now scrambling to find out all his/her bank accounts, investments, insurances, assets to stay afloat. Wouldn't it be nice if we are ready with such information thinking it is our last day and the message is ready to be triggered, if we are gone.

This is a service which does recurring Weekly/Monthly (configurable) Check-In for safety. In the absence of confirmation (by Email/Message/Phone/App) from user, it auto triggers the **last message** as saved by the user, which is an email that can include message, documents, audio, video etc... 

Idea is to make this a service similar to out-of-office reply, but which will trigger only if user fails to respond.

# Why? #
Life is uncertain

# What? #
A service to perform automated check-in by Email/Message/Phone, or even App. All that is needed is a YES to whether user is safe. In case of no response, increase the frequency, and after certain unresponsiveness (user choice), send the automated email message to the pre-established family member email address.
